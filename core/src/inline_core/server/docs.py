API_DESCRIPTION = """
The engine behind OpenChar Studio. Send it a graph of nodes, it renders, you fetch the files.

```
Graph (what to make)  ->  Run (one execution)  ->  Takes (the output files)
```

A **take** is one output file: the image or video a node produced, plus the settings that made it.
Running the same graph again adds another take instead of replacing the last one, so nothing you
generate is ever lost.

Graphs are checked before anything runs, so a bad one comes back at submit rather than half way
through a render.

## Start here

| What you want to do | Where |
| --- | --- |
| See every node, its ports and its params | `GET /v1/models` |
| List installed weights, or download more | the `models` channels |
| Run a graph | `POST /v1/runs` |
| Watch it run | the `/v1/runs/{id}/events` websocket |
| See what is queued or running, and cancel | `GET /v1/runs`, `DELETE /v1/runs/{id}` |
| Import files, and list the library | `POST /upload`, the `assets` channels |
| Organise or delete outputs in a project | the `frames` channels |
| Fetch a take, or its file | `GET /v1/takes/{id}`, `/bytes`, `/media/...` |

Names like `models`, `assets` and `frames` are channel groups on `POST /rpc`, every one of them
listed at the end of this page.

Anything under `/v1` is the engine contract, and it is versioned. Everything else is the Studio app
backend: it moves with the app, and it all goes through that one `/rpc` endpoint. This server also
serves the web UI, so the app and both APIs share an origin.

## Errors

`/v1` answers with a real status and a body of
`{"error": {"code": ..., "message": ..., "nodeId": ...}}`. You will see 404 for a run or take that
does not exist, 409 for a `clientRunId` reused with a different graph, and 422 for a graph that
failed its type check.

Two exceptions. The `/media` and `/download/*` routes answer with a plain text body. And `/rpc`
never reports failure with a status code at all, which its section explains.

## There is no authentication

Nothing on this page is authenticated. The server binds `127.0.0.1` by default, and that is the
only thing protecting it. Starting it with `--listen` (or `INLINE_HOST=0.0.0.0`) publishes every
route here to the network, including `POST /rpc`, which can open projects, start downloads and
write files. Put it behind something before you expose it.

_RUNS_WEBSOCKET = """
### `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/events` (websocket)

Progress for one run. An unknown run id closes the socket with code **4404** rather than answering
an HTTP status.

The first frame is always the current state, so a client that connects late misses nothing:

```json
{"type": "snapshot", "runId": "...", "state": { ...RunStateOut... }}
```

After that, one frame per event: `progress`, `node_done`, `run_started`, `run_done`, `cancelled`,
`error`. If the run had already finished when you connected, the socket closes after the snapshot.
""".strip()

_STUDIO_WEBSOCKET_HEAD = """
### `GET /events` (websocket)

The app-wide event stream. Every frame is:

```json
{"channel": "events:<name>", "payload": <any>}
```

A port value is single-shot, so progress cannot travel through one. A node emits a run id instead,
and its stream is matched to that id here. The trainer's loss curve and the sweep logger both work
this way.

Every Studio call the UI makes is one `POST /rpc` with `{"channel", "args"}`.

exception a handler raises. Read `ok`, never the status code. A non-200 here is a transport
failure.

Argument types are not described below. Handlers take a positional list and the typed contract
lives on the client side, in `src/shared/ipc.ts` (`IpcChannels` and `InlineStudioApi`). Four
channels in that contract never reach this server at all, because the browser answers them itself:
`shell:openExternal`, `clipboard:writeText`, `media:copyImage`, `media:save`.
